- Make sure you have game activity thingy enabled in "settings > game activity" tab
- Make sure you have discord desktop application open
- I might have made some mistake in the code, create a pull request
- Last but not least, make sure you are on "discord" duh...


# Also if you happen to come across this error, just ignore it
```(node:5620) Warning: N-API is an experimental feature and could change at any time.```
